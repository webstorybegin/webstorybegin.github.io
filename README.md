The basic function of the game "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" is to be implemented: 

- The grader answers one of the 12 questions by line.
- Each question has 4 variants of answers and only one correct answer.
- If the answer is correct, the grader proceeds to the next question. If the answer is wrong, the player goes to the final screen.
- The final screen must show the final result of the game. Design for layout [available] (https://www.figma.com/file/tIZEZn2HTAeSDQRzoOzvXE/Front-end-test%2C-Headway). The layout must be adaptive.

### Technical requirements:

- Use this [layout](https://www.figma.com/file/tIZEZn2HTAeSDQRzoOzvXE/Front-end-test%2C-Headway) for layout.
- Make the layout adaptive (from iPhone 5 to 4k displays).
- Make the layout without using CSS frameworks.
- Context of the game (questions, answers, money for the right answer, etc.) must be in json format.
- The contest must be extended: more or fewer variants of answers to the questions; a number of correct answers, etc.
- The task must be implemented using the latest version of React.
- The result of the work posted on github (+ github pages demo) with md-instructions on installation and launch.
- All client code must be fully compliant with out-of-the-box eslint/airbnb rules.

### Optionally:

- Make all client code typeable via TypeScript.
- On git commit in the middle of the test task repository, add running eslint on the modified files, and on git push, run unit-tests.

### Evaluation criteria:

- A layout that will be nondescript to expand and maintain.
- Code structure.
- Correct handling of out-of-the-box situations.

It is necessary to make the layout of landing page, [layout for layout](https://www.figma.com/file/jU4uEiOYLAlSnGJWYhPDIL/Headway-Front-End-Test-Task?node-id=0%3A1) is given. Description of the functional and optional tasks you will find in the comments to the layout for the link above.

You can adapt layout for desktop as you see fit.

### Technical requirements:

- Make the layout adaptive (from iPhone 5 to 4k displays).
- Make the layout without using CSS frameworks.
- Assignment to be implemented using the latest version of React.
- The result of the work posted on github (+ github pages demo).
- All client code must be fully compliant with the "out of the box" rules of eslint / airbnb.

### Evaluation criteria:

- A layout that will be nondescript to expand and maintain.
- Architectural organization of the code.
- Absence of layout shifts and blips.
